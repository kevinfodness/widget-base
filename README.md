widget-base
===========
A base class for building widgets in WordPress. Provides common functionality for implementing form fields to store data.

Usage: Copy the widget-base files into your theme directory and include the PHP class in your widget class. You will need to initialize the parent constructor and build out the widget() method in order to display the contents of the widget, and define $this->fields.
